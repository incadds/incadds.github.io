		<h2>What to do if the symptoms are present</h2>

		<p>The characteristics presented are just a guideline. However, if you answered yes to at least eight characteristics listed, for over a period of six months, the chances are the person meets the criteria for further investigation and assessment by a trained professional.</p>

		<h3>How is it treated?</h3>

		<p>Effective treatment generally requires a multi-modal approach, which includes the following components:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Early assessment/diagnosis and formulation of a management strategy</li>
			<li>Behavior Management training</li>
			<li>Special educational support at school</li>
			<li>Medication when appropriate</li>
			<li>Support for families</li>
		</ul>

		<p>All of the above may not be necessary. The approach to treatment and management will depend on the severity of the condition, co-existing difficulties (e.g. language disorders, and the age of diagnosis.</p>

		<h3>Where to go?</h3>

		<p>As a first step, talk to your General Practitioner and/or teacher.</p>

		<p>The General Practitioner may refer you to a specialist service.</p>

		<p><strong>INCADDS agrees with international medical experts that ADHD is a very treatable medical condition.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>The key is:</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Early diagnosis by a professional with expertise and experience in the area of ADHD.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Treatment Programmes including Health and Education to cover all aspects of the condition.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Continuous support for the entire family.</strong></li>
		</ol>
