		<h2>What is ADHD/HKD?</h2>
		<p><strong>INCADDS agrees with international medical experts that ADHD is a very treatable medical condition.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>The key is:</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Early diagnosis by a professional with expertise and experience in the area of ADHD.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Treatment Programmes including Health and Education to cover all aspects of the condition.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Continuous support for the entire family.</strong></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Definitions</h3>
		<p><strong>ADHD</strong> - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</p>

		<p><strong>HKD</strong> - Hyperkinetic Disorder</p>

		<p>The very severe form of ADHD/HKD is a neurological genetic condition.</p>

		<p>It is far more common in boys.</p>

		<p>It affects up to 5% of the school-going population.</p>

		<p>The severe form is marked by chronic behaviors with onset in the pre-school years. Milder forms first manifest themselves about the age of 7 years.</p>

		<h3>What causes it?</h3>
		<p>Scientists and medical experts do not know precisely what causes ADHD/HKD. Scientific evidence suggests that the disorder is genetically transmitted (often runs in families) and is caused by a chemical imbalance or deficiency in certain neurotransmitters (chemicals that regulate the efficiency with the brain controls behavior).</p>

		<h3>How long does it last?</h3>
		<p>Until recently it was thought sufferers "outgrew" the condition with the onset of puberty. However, recent studies show that of those diagnosed with ADHD/HKD in childhood, 60% will continue with a modified form of the condition into adulthood. The condition is four times more frequent in boys than in girls.</p>

		<p>As inattentiveness (rather than hyperactivity) is the major characteristic of female sufferers, there is a far greater chance of them not being diagnosed.</p>
