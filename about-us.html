		<h2>About INCADDS</h2>

		<p>Irish National Council of AD/HD Support Groups is an umbrella organisation for the AD/HD Support Groups active throughout the country. The support groups operate at a local level and provide services such as information, advice and emotional support to families of children with AD/HD. Some also operate a telephone help-line and organise activities such as seminars and summer camps. INCADDS, as the national organisation, is responsible for the co-ordination of these support groups. INCADDS also provides information to the Minister of Health and Children and the Minister of Education and Science on the disorder.</p>

		<p>It is the core mission of INCADDS to ensure that the difficulties for sufferers of AD/HD are minimised by the development and promotion of early diagnosis; the promotion of appropriate and comprehensive person-centred treatment; and by raising awareness of the disorder so that its sufferers will be better understood. In addition, INCADDS want to ensure that the families of sufferers of AD/HD are adequately supported so that they in turn can support their children and relatives.</p>

		<p>INCADDS is a registered Irish charity. Charity No <strong>CHY 13809</strong></p>

		<h3>INCADDS Aims</h3>

		<p>The following aims are not those that are in the Irish National of AD/HD Support Groups Constitution. Rather they were adopted for the purpose of the Strategic Plan as it was felt that they described more appropriately the work and plans
		of INCADDS;</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 1</strong><br />
		To raise awareness of AD/HD and co-existing conditions.</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 2</strong><br />
		To facilitate, inform and promote training opportunities for those involved in the service provision to people affected by AD/HD.</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 3</strong><br />
		To develop policies on AD/HD and to lobby to have these policies implemented.</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 4</strong><br />
		To develop appropriate networks and strategic links with relevant bodies at local, national and international level.</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 5</strong><br />
		To promote activities appropriate to the needs of people affected by AD/HD.</p>

		<p><strong>Aim 6</strong><br />
		To develop appropriate structures and access resources to implement this strategic plan.</p>
