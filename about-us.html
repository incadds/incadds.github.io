  <h2>About INCADDS</h2>

  <p>Irish National Council of AD/HD Support Groups is an umbrella organisation for the AD/HD Support Groups active throughout the country. The support groups operate at a local level and provide services such as information, advice and emotional support to families of children with AD/HD. Some also operate a telephone help-line and organise activities such as seminars and summer camps. INCADDS, as the national organisation, is responsible for the co-ordination of these support groups. INCADDS also provides information to the Minister of Health and Children and the Minister of Education and Science on the disorder.</p>

  <p>It is the core mission of INCADDS to ensure that the difficulties for sufferers of AD/HD are minimised by the development and promotion of early diagnosis; the promotion of appropriate and comprehensive person-centred treatment; and by raising awareness of the disorder so that its sufferers will be better understood. In addition, INCADDS want to ensure that the families of sufferers of AD/HD are adequately supported so that they in turn can support their children and relatives.</p>

  <p>INCADDS is a registered Irish charity. Charity No <strong>CHY 13809</strong></p>
