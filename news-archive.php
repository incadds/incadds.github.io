				<h3>	<p><span class="caps">HSE</span> Will Ensure Consistent Administration of Long Term Illness Card Nationally</p></h3>
							<p>	<p>From the Office of the Ombudsman:</p>

	<p><i>The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, has today welcomed the steps taken by the Health Service Executive (<span class="caps">HSE</span>) to ensure that the Long Term Illness card scheme does not discriminate on the basis of where an applicant lives. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, &#8216;Local Rules for National Schemes &#8211; Inequities in the administration of the Long Term Illness Card Scheme&rsquo;, follows a refusal by the <span class="caps">HSE</span> to award a Long Term Illness Card (<span class="caps">LTI</span> card) to a boy diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (<span class="caps">ADHD</span>).  The <span class="caps">HSE</span> refused the <span class="caps">LTI</span> card on the grounds that the boy did not meet the medical criteria for eligibility.  In her complaint to the Ombudsman, the boy&rsquo;s mother, Ms Kelly (not her real name), contended that her son met the relevant medical criteria and she claimed that had he lived elsewhere in Ireland (he lives in Wexford), her son would have been awarded a <span class="caps">LTI</span> card.</i></p>

							<p>	<p><b>European Mental Health Services Fail the AD/HD Test     <br />
Press Release ADHD-Europe &#8211; 21/05/2009</b></p>

	<p>Mental health care professionals, including psychologists and psychiatrists, frequently have little or no specialized training in treating Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), the most common lifelong mental health problem.</p>

	<p>In a newly published survey, Diagnosis&Treatment of AD/HD in Europe: Differences, Problems and Progress, ADHD-Europe examines provision for the treatment and diagnosis of AD/HD in 19 European countries.</p>

	<p>Despite some improvements, the survey found provision for AD/HD diagnosis and treatment in crisis. As demand for diagnostic assessment increases, European mental health professionals still receive little or no specialized training in the proper diagnosis and treatment of AD/HD, resulting in insufficient diagnostic services, long waiting times (children can wait for years), inadequate and inappropriate treatment availability for children and less for adults.</p>

	<p>A spokeswoman for TDA/H Belgique, Wallonia, Belgium said:</p>

	<p>Sometimes it is truly an uphill battle. Some health professionals still know very little about this disorder. Doctors, including psychiatrists and neurologists, look for psychological and/or educational causes.</p>

	<p>AD/HD is not caused by poor parenting, changes in the pace of modern society or too much television; it is a neurodevelopmental disorder with core symptoms of inattention and impulsivity, with or without hyperactivity. The causes are complex, but around 80 % of the risk factor is genetic, with approximately 5-6 % of children and 3-5 % of adults being thought to meet the <span class="caps">DSM-IV</span> TR diagnostic criteria. In addition to impairments resulting from these symptoms, sufferers and their families may also be affected by social stigma. Treatment offers children a release from the misery and isolation brought about by their behavioural symptoms, as well as improvements in family life and educational achievement. Untreated AD/HD can lead to pervasive lifetime impairment, but the outlook can be much improved with proper treatment.</p>

	<p>http://www.adhdeurope.eu/</p>

	<p>ADHD-Europe aisbl is a European non-profit umbrella organization which received full legal recognition in Belgium in April 2009. At present, ADHD-Europe represents 27 National and Regional organizations concerned with AD/HD from 19 countries who have worked together since 2005 for the improvement of the situation of those affected by AD/HD.</p>

	<p>The survey will be available on May 21, 2009 from ADHD-Europe aisbl, Avenskouter 13, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.</p>

	<p>ADHD-Europe wants to raise public awareness about AD/HD and influence the European decision-makers on behalf of people affected by this disorder. ADHD-Europe will do this through the prevention of stigma and discriminatory practices and through the promotion of inclusive practices in the medical, family, school and labour settings across Europe.</p>

							<p>	<p><b><span class="caps">ADHD</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span> &#8211; <span class="caps">INCADDS</span><br />
Press Release September 2008</b></p>

	<p>First National <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Awareness Week launched 22nd September 2008. <br />
83% of Irish parents of children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (<span class="caps">ADHD</span>) reported that they often or always got stressed about their child&#8217;s condition. 79% reported that symptoms impact on family functioning. A further 69% of parents have difficulty getting their child ready in the morning and 58% reported difficulty with their child falling asleep at night. These new findings were revealed today at the launch of Ireland&#8217;s first national <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Awareness Week, a joint initiative of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span> and <span class="caps">INCADDS</span> (Irish National Council of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Support Groups). </p>

	<p>The Irish National <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Awareness Week is part of a larger Europe-wide <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Awareness Week aiming to increase knowledge of the signs and symptoms of <span class="caps">ADHD</span>, its impact on the <span class="caps">ADHD</span> child and their family and the support mechanisms available. The Awareness Week is taking place from the 22-28 September 2008. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">ADHD</span> is a neurobiological condition affecting 3-7% of school children, roughly two children in every classroom. The core symptoms of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness which are not in keeping with those of the same age group and development level. For example, a child with <span class="caps">ADHD</span> is easily distracted, finds it difficult to complete tasks and has difficulty returning to the task, if distracted. He or she may also act impulsively, move and speak rapidly and excessively, and may often respond or act inappropriately, without thinking.</p>

	<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">ADHD</span> is highly hereditary&#8221; <br />
Commenting at the launch of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> Awareness Day, Professor Michael Fitzgerald, Prof of Child Psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin and chairman of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span> said &#8216;We are delighted to use today as a platform to increase levels of knowledge and understanding of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> amongst the Irish people. It is a common condition, one which can have a huge impact not only on the person living with it but also on the entire family unit. Early diagnosis and access to treatment is essential for these children so that the symptoms of this disorder can be treated as quickly as possible. Knowing how to manage symptoms is imperative as this may allow children and their families the opportunity to live a more normal life with respite from the disruption of <span class="caps">ADHD</span>.&#8217; </p>

	<p>The nationwide survey of 150 Irish parents of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> diagnosed children was part of Ireland&#8217;s first ever nationwide survey of this kind. Entitled &#8216;A survey of <span class="caps">ADHD</span> in Irish children&#8217;, the results together with information on the condition and local support groups operating in Ireland are available in book format. The research was conducted by <span class="caps">ADHD</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span>, a multi-disciplinary group whose aim is to educate the general public, patients and health professionals on <span class="caps">ADHD</span> with the ultimate aim of improving quality of life for people with <span class="caps">ADHD</span>. <span class="caps">ADHD</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span> is supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Eli Lilly & Co. </p>

	<p>&#8216;Bringing up a child with <span class="caps">ADHD</span> is not just a case of having to cope with them being fidgety or not being able to concentrate for half an hour or so. <span class="caps">ADHD</span> is a condition that affects all aspects the whole family&#8217;s life of the time. Education and life milestones are the most common cause for concern amongst parents. Lack of friends, aggressiveness and if they will ever lead a normal happy life are all issues parents are worried about,&#8217; commented Ray Kavanagh, Chairman, <span class="caps">INCADDS</span>. </p>
