		<h2>Tips for parents</h2>

		<h3>Homework</h3>

		<p>Homework can cause great friction between children and their parents. For children with ADD/ADHD,</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Explain to the child and if possible the parent that homework should be done within a set time-frame - a timer can be useful tool for this.</li>
			<li>Advise parents of children with ADD/ADHD, if the child is struggling with their homework, to cease activity before the child becomes too frustrated.</li>
			<li>Whether or not the task is fully completed within the specified time-frame should be viewed as an accomplishment in itself.</li>
			<li>Different forms of homework could be considered e.g. home computer, tape recorder, practical exercises (measuring a room).</li>
			<li>Bringing home the correct set of books presents difficulties for children with ADD/ADHD and parents may purchase a second set of books, which remain at home.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How does the future look for my child?</h3>

		<p>We cannot emphasise enough how important it is NOT to ignore the fact that your child may have a condition that he needs help with. It's not shameful and your child is normal. If you can have your child assessed and diagnosed early, your child can have as good a future as anybody else. The important thing is to act as soon as possible.</p>
